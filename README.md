Converter
=========

Convert is a simple, fast paced minigame. 
2 teams (Red and Blue) and they all have an infinite supply of snowballs. (2 second cooldown each time you throw a snowball)
Object of the game is to "convert" all other players to your team. To do this you hit an enemy with a snowball then they will be
on your team. To finish the game you must get all players on one team. Your armor color (red/blue) will indicate what team you're on.
